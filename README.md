# Background

This bootstrap-template was forked from [https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume) and was discovered on the [Start Bootstrap website](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume).

`npm` and `node` were updated.  The installation was unsucessful. The basic files were included in the repo and the css was modified in the `styles.css` file.  Efforts should continue for the developer installation as changing of css variables are preferred to making changes to the base `.css`. The template was easy to work with, fast and clean.
